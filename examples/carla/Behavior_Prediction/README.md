# Behavior Prediction Scenarios

## Intersection
01. Ego vehicle goes straight at signalized intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle from oncoming parallel lane makes an unprotected left turn.
02. Ego vehicle makes an unprotected left turn at signalized intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle from oncoming parallel lane goes straight.
03. Ego vehicle either goes straight or makes an unprotected left turn at signalized intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle from perpendicular lane continues straight shortly after light turns red.
04. Ego vehicle either goes straight or makes an unprotected left turn at signalized intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle from perpendicular lane makes a left turn shortly after light turns red.
05. Ego vehicle waits for an adversary vehicle to pass before performing a lane change to bypass a stationary vehicle waiting to make an unprotected left turn.

## Passing
01. Ego vehicle performs a lane change to bypass a slow adversary vehicle before returning to its original lane.
02. Advesary vehicle performs a lange change to bypass the ego vehicle before returning to its original lane.
03. Ego vehicle performs a lane change to bypass a slow adversary vehicle but cannot return to its original lane because the adversary accelerates. Ego vehicle must then slow down to avoid collision with leading vehicle in new lane.
04. Ego vehicle performs multiple lane changes to bypass three slow adversary vehicles.

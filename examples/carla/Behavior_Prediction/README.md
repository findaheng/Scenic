## Intersection
01. Ego vehicle either goes straight or makes an unprotected left turn at signalized intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle from parallel lane makes an unprotected left turn.
02. Ego vehicle either goes straight or makes an unprotected left turn at signalized intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle from perpendicular lane continues shortly after red light, going either straight or left.

## Passing
01. Ego vehicle performs a lane change to bypass a slow adversary vehicle before returning to its original lane.
02. Advesary vehicle performs a lange change to bypass the ego vehicle before returning to its original lane.

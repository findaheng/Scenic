# Behavior Prediction Scenarios

## Intersection
01. Ego vehicle goes straight at signalized intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle from oncoming parallel lane makes an unprotected left turn.
02. Ego vehicle makes an unprotected left turn at signalized intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle from oncoming parallel lane goes straight.
03. Ego vehicle either goes straight or makes an unprotected left turn at signalized intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle from perpendicular lane continues straight shortly after light turns red.
04. Ego vehicle either goes straight or makes an unprotected left turn at signalized intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle from perpendicular lane makes a left turn shortly after light turns red.

## Passing
01. Ego vehicle performs a lane change to bypass a slow adversary vehicle before returning to its original lane.
02. Advesary vehicle performs a lange change to bypass the ego vehicle before returning to its original lane.

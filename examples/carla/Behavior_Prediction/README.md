# Behavior Prediction Scenario Descriptions

## Intersection
01. Ego vehicle goes straight at 4-way intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle from opposite lane makes a left turn. (source: NHSTA, #30)
02. Ego vehicle makes a left turn at 4-way intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle from opposite lane goes straight. (source: NHSTA, #30)
03. Ego vehicle either goes straight or makes a left turn at 4-way intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle from lateral lane continues straight. (source: NHSTA, #28 #29)
04. Ego vehicle either goes straight or makes a left turn at 4-way intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle from lateral lane makes a left turn. (source: NHSTA, #28 #29)
05. Ego vehicle makes a right turn at 4-way intersection while adversary vehicle from opposite lane makes a left turn. (source: NHSTA, #25) (TIP)
06. Ego vehicle makes a right turn at 4-way intersection while adversary vehicle from lateral lane goes straight. (source: NHSTA, #25 #26) (TIP)
07. Ego vehicle makes a left turn at 3-way intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle from lateral lane continues straight. (source: NHSTA, #30) (TIP)
08. Ego vehicle goes straight at 3-way intersection and must suddenly stop to avoid collision when adversary vehicle makes a left turn. (source: NHSTA #30) (TIP)
09. Ego vehicle makes a right turn at 3-way intersection while adversary vehicle from lateral lane goes straight. (source: NHSTA, #28 #29) (TIP)

## Bypassing
01. Ego vehicle performs a lane change to bypass a slow adversary vehicle before returning to its original lane. (source: NHSTA, #16)
02. Advesary vehicle performs a lange change to bypass the ego vehicle before returning to its original lane. (source: NHSTA, #16)
03. Ego vehicle performs a lane change to bypass a slow adversary vehicle but cannot return to its original lane because the adversary accelerates. Ego vehicle must then slow down to avoid collision with leading vehicle in new lane. (source: NHSTA, #16)
04. Ego vehicle performs multiple lane changes to bypass two slow adversary vehicles. (source: NHSTA, #16) (TIP)
05. Ego vehicle performs multiple lane changes to bypass three slow adversary vehicles. (source: NHSTA, #16) (TIP)
06. Ego vehicle waits for adversary vehicle to pass before performing a lane change to bypass a stationary vehicle waiting to make a left turn at a 4-way intersection. (source: NHSTA, #16)
